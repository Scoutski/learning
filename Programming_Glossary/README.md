## Atomic Data:
> Atomic data is data in it's most basic form so that it could not be broken down further to better represent information. This comes from chemistry and physics where the smallest particle that can represent an element is the atom.
> _e.g. Total sales = 500_

## Orthogonalilty:
> Orthogonal designs/functions are independent of other designs/functions and should operate the same regardless of whether or not a different pattern is used or a different function is run. Orthogonality also the basis of functional programming where a function does not have any side-effects.
> _e.g. (x) => x + 2_ will always produce the same result given the same input without effecting the value of x outside of the function.
