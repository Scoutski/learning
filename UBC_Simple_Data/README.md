## :muscle: Motivation

Although I've been programming in JavaScript professionally for close to 3 years, I still feel that my theoretical knowledge could always use improving.

This course was the first listed on [OSSU's](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) (Open Source Society University) Computer Science track. Although I don't necessarily plan to complete every course, I hope to improve my understanding of system designs, data structures, algorithms and overall programming skills by completing some of the courses listed on the OSSU page.
