## :notebook: Notes

- **Compound data** is used when two or more pieces of related data should be kept together inside of a single structure.
- BSL uses a function called **define-struct** to create a compound data structure. The full format is:
  - (define-struct _structureName_ (prop1, prop2, ...))
